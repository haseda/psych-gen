# Psych sheets generator

Psych sheets generator for WCA competitions.


## Requirements

Following python version and some python libraries are required:

* Python 2.7
* Jinja2

_Python 2.7.10_ and _Jinja2 2.8_ are recommended version because I develop and test with it.


## Usage

1. Fill `competitors.txt` with the competitors list (sample data is already written).
2. Fill `events.txt` with the events list (sample data is already written).
3. Run `generate.py`.
4. You will soon get psych sheets in your `psych.html`


## Notes

* You need only Python and some related libraries, you do not need any web server or MySQL.
* Event format in `events.txt` only accepts following terms: 333, 444, 555, 222, 333bf, 333oh, 333fm, 333ft, minx, pyram, sq1, clock, skewb, 666, 777, 444bf, 555bf, 333mbf


## Future works

I will write some here.
